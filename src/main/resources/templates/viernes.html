				<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
					text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45
					BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
					professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
					the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
					passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
					literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
					from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
					Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
					BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
					during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
					dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The
					standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
					below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
					Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
					exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
					translation by H. Rackham. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum
